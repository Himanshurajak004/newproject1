            Thankyou for showing interest, 
 Hello everyone! BCA Honours/Research student and I’m passionate about technology and programming. I'm currently in my first year at Amity University, Jharkhand and I’m focusing on building my skills and I'm particularly interested to learn new technologies like AIML, Web3, full-stack development and I'm in the learning phase in this dynamic field for greater opportunities . 
 Apart from this My hobbies include taekwondo, where I hold a green belt. This activity has taught me important values like discipline and focus, and it helps me stay calm in challenging situations. I like 
            coding all kind of problems 
            from the very basic like adding 
            numbers to the complex ones like
            competitive programming problems.
            I love making projects and games.
            Infact this website is one of my 
            Web Development Projects which 
            is built using HTML and CSS.<br>
            <br>Languages known : C Language, 
             JAVA, Python, JavaScript, 
            MySQL.<br>
